# Supermarket Application

This project consists of a React client and a Node.js server. Docker Compose is used to manage the development environment, including a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Docker Compose Setup

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines three services: `client`, `server`, and `mongo`.

### Services

- **client**: Runs the React application.
- **server**: Runs the Node.js server.
- **mongo**: Runs the MongoDB database.

### Volumes

- `mongo-data`: A named volume used to persist MongoDB data.

## How to Use

### Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supermarket-app.git
   cd supermarket-app
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the React application at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. The Node.js server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. The MongoDB database will be accessible at `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

### Stopping the Containers

To stop the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Cleaning Up

To remove the containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

## Notes

- The `client` service uses the `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` environment variable to enable polling for file changes. This is useful for development environments, especially on Docker for Windows and Mac.
- The `server` service depends on the `mongo` service to ensure that MongoDB is started before the server.
